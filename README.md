# Video Frame Extractor (for anime mostly)
 A Colab Notebook to extract frame form a video for collecting dataset for training <p>
The purpose i made it because [fanscaps](https://fancaps.net/) sometime doesn't have recent screencap for anime that recently aired. <p>
And also no needed to download a gigs raw anime episode for just some pics especially when you have limited internet data.
